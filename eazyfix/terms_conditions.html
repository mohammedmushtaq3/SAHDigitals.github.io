            <h3 class="text-left mb-4">Authorizing Work:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">You authorize EazyFix to perform the work described in the Service Estimate (“Service”) on the device identified on the front of this Service Authorization/Receipt (“Your Device”), subject to these Terms and Conditions. If Your Device is under
                any applicable manufacturer’s warranty, then the terms of EazyFix's Limited Warranty (see below) also apply and will control if there is any conflict with these terms. In particular, if the Warranty Status of Your Device shown on the front
                of this Service Authorization is “In Warranty” and EazyFix determines on further inspection that the issue with Your Device is not covered by the Limited Warranty (for example, there is damage due to exposure to liquid), then additional
                charges not shown in the Service Estimate may apply. In that case, EazyFix will notify you of the additional charges prior to starting work on your device. Service on Your Device will not begin unless and until you authorize the additional
                charges. If you receive a loaner device to use while Your Device is being serviced, and you lose or damage that Loaner Device, you will be charged and liable for the retail price of the Loaner Device.</p>
            <h3 class="text-left mb-4">Data on Device:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">You are solely responsible for backing up any data on Your Device and deleting, encrypting, or otherwise protecting your data from unauthorized use. EazyFix will not back up or restore your data and is not responsible for any data that is
                lost or corrupted. EazyFix will not treat data on Your Device as confidential and disclaims any agreement with you or other obligations to do so.</p>
            <h3 class="text-left mb-4">EazyFix Responsibilities &amp; Limited Warranty:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">EazyFix may use rebuilt, reconditioned, or new parts or components when repairing Your Device. Repaired/replaced cases, pouches, and holsters will be warranted for a period of ninety (90) days. All other repaired/replaced devices will be warranted
                for a period equal to the remainder of the applicable manufacturer’s original Limited Warranty on the original device if any, or for ninety (90) days (or one year for all applicable “premium” and “premium plus” repairs), whichever is longer.
                If Your Device should malfunction, it must be returned to the EazyFix store or service center for evaluation, and all costs of shipping will be borne solely by the purchaser. EazyFix's customer service department will diagnose the repair
                upon receipt. Upon examination by EazyFix, if Your Device is found to be defective it will be repaired or replaced at no charge. This warranty does not apply to defects resulting from any action by you, including but not limited to mishandling,
                physical damage, water damage, improper interfacing, operation outside of design limits, improper repair by someone other than EazyFix, use of any other product other than EazyFix products, or unauthorized modification. This warranty is
                VOID if Your Device shows evidence of having been tampered with (broken seal) or shows evidence of being damaged as a result of excessive corrosion; or current, heat, moisture or vibration; improper specification; misapplication; misuse;
                abuse or other operating conditions outside of EazyFix's control. Software warranty applies to factory restores, backups, jailbreaks, unlocks, and applies to computers, laptops, cellular phones, etc. The warranty is VOID if the customer
                performs any software modifications not limited to restore, updating software on the device, downloading unauthorized or unapproved software, viruses, malware, spyware, or attempts to modify any software that has been installed by EazyFix.
                EazyFix employees reserve the right to VOID its warranty if any improper software installations or modifications have been made after the customer has left the store location. Unless otherwise required by law, all replaced devices, parts,
                components, boards, and equipment will become the property of EazyFix, and you waive all rights you may have under state or other laws to the replaced device or repaired or replaced parts. Subject to paragraph 2 above regarding data, EazyFix
                will be responsible to the extent provided under applicable law for the physical safekeeping of Your Device while in EazyFix's possession for Service. If Your Device is lost or damaged while it is in EazyFix's possession for Service, EazyFix
                will repair Your Device or replace it with an equivalent device, which at EazyFix's option may be new or refurbished. If you fail to pick up your device or otherwise arrange for its return after repeated efforts to contact you, after thirty
                (30) days following the completion of repairs EazyFix will treat the device as abandoned and may dispose of the property in its sole discretion in accordance with applicable provisions of law, including sale to recoup administrative and
                repair costs.</p>
            <h3 class="text-left mb-4">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY/INDEMNITY:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">THE LIMITED WARRANTY STATED ABOVE SETS OUT THE FULL EXTENT OF EazyFix's RESPONSIBILITIES, AND THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY REGARDING WORK PERFORMED OR PARTS SUPPLIED BY EazyFix IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE ON YOUR DEVICE. ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
                INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ARE LIMITED TO THE DURATION OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY. IN NO EVENT WILL EazyFix BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT
                DUE FOR THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, COMMERCIAL LOSS OF ANY SORT; LOSS OF USE, TIME, DATA, REPUTATION, OPPORTUNITY, GOODWILL, PROFITS OR SAVINGS; INCONVENIENCE; INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; OR DAMAGES
                ARISING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT. SOME STATES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, OR THE DISCLAIMER OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THESE LIMITATIONS
                AND DISCLAIMERS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. EazyFix IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY FAILURE OR DELAY IN PERFORMANCE TO THE EXTENT CAUSE BY CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND ITS REASONABLE CONTROL. YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY EazyFix FROM AND AGAINST ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT
                AGAINST IT ARISING FROM YOUR BREACH OF APPLICABLE LAW OR THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</p>
            <h3 class="text-left mb-4">No Modification:<br></h3>
            <p class="text-justify">No agent, employee, dealer, representative or reseller is authorized to modify these Terms and Conditions, to extend the Limited Warranty above or to make binding representations or claims, whether in advertising, presentations or otherwise,
                on behalf of EazyFix regarding the Service.</p>
            <h3 class="text-left mb-4">Severability</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">You and EazyFix agree that it is our intention that these Terms and Conditions be enforceable in accordance with their terms to the fullest extent permitted by law. You and EazyFix agree that if any portion of these Terms and Conditions are
                adjudged by a court or arbitrator to be invalid or unenforceable, that adjudication will not invalidate the remainder of these Terms and Conditions and they will be fully enforceable.</p>
            <h3 class="text-left mb-4">Entire Agreement</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">To the extent permitted by applicable law, these Terms and Conditions state all terms agreed by the parties and supersede all other agreements by the parties relating to its subject matter.</p>
            <h3 class="text-left mb-4">Meta - Data</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">You understand and agree EazyFix will collect Meta - Data logs during diagnostic evaluation to improve the overall future functionality of the diagnostic tool and symptom evaluation in the repair process. The data collected will be used solely
                by EazyFix to enhance and improve this process, may be shared with EazyFix affiliates, and will not be distributed further without your consent. Data types that may be collected from your device include a device phone number, device model
                number, device IMEI, device serial number, downloaded applications &amp; their respective settings and host applications &amp; their respective settings.</p>
            <h3 class="text-left mb-4">Applicable Law &amp; Dispute Resolution:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The formation, existence, construction, performance, validity and all aspects whatsoever of these Terms and Conditions will be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without reference to its choice of laws principle; ALL DISPUTES WITH
                EazyFix ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THE SERVICE, INCLUDING THE ISSUE OF ARBITRABILITY, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, AND NOT BY A COURT OR JURY. Any such dispute will not be combined or consolidated with
                a dispute involving service provided to any other person or entity, and specifically, without limitation of the foregoing, will not under any circumstances proceed as part of a class action or class arbitration. The arbitration will be
                conducted before a single arbitrator, whose award may not exceed, in form or amount, the relief allowed by the applicable law. The venue for all arbitrations will be in Orange County, Florida. The arbitration will be conducted according
                to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) Commercial Arbitration Rules applicable to consumer disputes and is entered pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator will decide all issues of interpretation and application
                of this arbitration provision and the Terms and Conditions. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s award in any court of competent jurisdiction. This arbitration provision also applies to claims against EazyFix employees, representatives,
                and affiliates if any such claim arises from the Service.</p>
            <h3 class="text-left mb-4">Arbitration Opt-Out</h3>
